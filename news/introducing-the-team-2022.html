    <div class="prose max-w-none mx-auto">
      <p>In 2022, der BioIT was born — not as a company with a product, but as a collective of people with a mission.</p>
      <p>At its core, der BioIT is a response to a shared frustration: bioinformatics is often too expensive, too inaccessible, and too complicated for the people who need it most. We knew there had to be a better way — so we set out to build it.</p>
      <p>The founding team came together from diverse corners of science and industry. Matvii brought hands-on experience from diagnostics and clinical genomics; Nadiia, a background in public health and strategy; Dariia, nonprofit leadership and organizational vision. Anna shaped our communications and outreach efforts, Yuliia architected our software frameworks, and Liliia infused fresh energy and data science curiosity into everything we touched.</p>
      <p>From day one, we made three things non-negotiable:<br>Openness. Practicality. People-first design.</p>
      <p>We didn’t want to build “just another pipeline.” We wanted to create tools that clinicians could actually use, that researchers could actually afford, and that would scale across borders — from teaching hospitals in Europe to outreach labs in underserved regions.</p>
      <p>2022 was our starting line. We spent countless hours testing open-source tools, sketching pipeline blueprints on café napkins, rewriting error logs at 2 a.m., and building something that felt grounded in reality but driven by ambition.</p>
      <p>By the end of that year, we weren’t just colleagues — we were a team. A team committed to bringing modern bioinformatics to the people who need it most, without the usual gatekeeping. der BioIT is still growing, but it began with this simple idea:<br>Science should be shared. And good science should be usable.</p>
      <p>Welcome to the beginning of that journey.</p>
