    <div class="prose max-w-none mx-auto space-y-4">
      <p>By mid-2023, our collaboration with Leogen officially concluded — marking the successful completion of one of our earliest and most rewarding partnerships.</p>
      <p>What started in 2022 as a request for technical help had grown into a full-scale custom pipeline build, strategic consulting process, and long-term support mission. Now, after months of iterative development, real-world validation, and clinical rollout, we had delivered exactly what we set out to create: a robust, reliable, and interpretable WES analysis solution for paraffin-embedded embryonic samples.</p>
      <p>Working with Leogen challenged us in all the right ways. FFPE-derived embryonic tissue is some of the most difficult material to work with — fragmented, chemically modified, and highly sensitive to artifacts. But through careful filtering, damage-aware alignment, variant calling optimization, and clean reporting infrastructure, we turned noisy data into usable insight. And most importantly, we did it in a way that matched the needs of clinicians, not just data scientists.</p>
      <p>Throughout 2023, Leogen began deploying the pipeline in real diagnostic workflows, analyzing patient samples with confidence and speed. It wasn’t just functional — it was trusted. That was our metric for success.</p>
      <p>Finishing the project meant more than handing off a final version. We delivered:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Detailed documentation for internal and regulatory use</li>
        <li>Training sessions for Leogen’s lab and interpretation teams</li>
        <li>Pipeline modularity to ensure adaptability for future use cases</li>
        <li>Ongoing technical guidance during early clinical integration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By the time the project ended, Leogen had transitioned from concept to clinical readiness — and we had helped build a key part of that journey.</p>
      <p>For us at der BioIT, the end of this project wasn’t a conclusion. It was proof of principle. That a small, interdisciplinary team can solve hard problems in genomic diagnostics — fast, transparently, and without locking anyone into proprietary black boxes.</p>
      <p>We’re proud of what we built together with Leogen. Proud of the science. Proud of the collaboration. And proud that this pipeline will continue to support families navigating complex reproductive decisions long after our code has been run.</p>
